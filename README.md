#iBeacon Tour Starter

by [Christopher Stevens](http://www.christopherstevens.cc)

Note: Nothing to see here... yet. It will function soon!

This is a starter PhoneGap app built for the purpose of exploring self-guided iBeacon-triggered Drupal 8 powered exhibit tours. It's part of an upcoming presentation on the subject. Stay tuned a better project description and instructions. ;)

See [iBeacon Ranger](https://github.com/owntheweb/ibeacon-ranger), an iBeacon diagnostic tool leading the way to this app.

This app is co-sponsored by the [Space Foundation](http://www.spacefoundation.org).

In addition to personal time spent on this project, extra special thanks goes to the Space Foundation team, supplying iBeacon hardware, an iOS developer account and even a few on-the-clock training hours to dedicate towards iBeacon research. The Space Foundation is aiming to improve attendee navigational experiences at the annual [Space Symposium](http://www.spacesymposium.org) via a useful app map. We're also exploring options for future use in the [Space Foundation Discovery Center](http://www.spacefoundation.org/museum). You too can help the Space Foundation achieve their mission to inspire, enable and propel, by contributing to this project. :D
